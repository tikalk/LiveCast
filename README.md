LiveCast
========

Tikal's Fuseday JS Session Concept - a live screencast system for remote

##Getting Started##
1. Clone the repo
2. cd into LiveCast
3. Run npm install (first time) - second time run npm update
3. run: node app.js
4. go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

##Static content##
All the static (js, css & img) content is located under /public.


/views/index.ejs renders to "index.html" so this is the main view for the app.

>The templating engine is [ejs](http://embeddedjs.com/) (very similar to jsp scriptlets).
